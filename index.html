    <h3>Intro to JavaScript & HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p class="text">This module introduced me to Javascript and HTML/CSS, teaching me the basics of web page development/design using HTML/CSS, as well as how to make the page interactive through the use of Javascript. Along with this, the JavaScript course also taught me how to create animations and how to use OOP (object-oriented programming) through the use of prototypes. Both of these courses helped to create a solid foundation for me to complete the following modules.</p>
    
    <h3>Games & Visualizations</h3>
      <p class="text">The games and visualizations module put my JS skills to the test in walking me through how to create two games, and having me modify each game. I found this module to be very interesting and enjoyable to work through as I have always enjoyed video games. I found the challenge of modifying the games to be very engaging, and I was satisfied with the finished products. </p>
    
    <h3>Natural Simulations</h3>  
      <p class="text">As the name suggests, this module taught me how to create natural simulations in JS. I found this course to be fairly challenging but very fascinating. This course allowed me to create various projects that simulated our real world. I learnt how to simulate basic physics (forces, angular velocity, oscillations etc.) with JS and I learnt how to create more natural randomness, along with object inheritance and particle systems. Not only did this course help with my programming skills, but it also added onto my knowledge of physics and mathematics. </p>

    <h3>Learn Javascript Course</h3>
      <p class="text">This module helped with solidifying my prior knowledge of JavaScript (from Khan Academy) through giving me more practice, as well as explaining certain concepts in different terms. Not only did this course help solidify my knowledge, but it also taught me some new concepts in JavaScript. For instance iterators, arrow functions, and more advanced uses of object oriented programming. </p>
    
    <h3>Learn Game Development With Phaser.js Course</h3>
      <p class="text">Phaser.js is an HTML5 framework that assists in developing games. This module taught me the basics of phaser such as syntax, physics, animations and effects. </p>
  </div>
  
  <!--Course Projects Section-->

  <div class="modules">
    <h3>Algorithms Exploration</h3>
      <p class="text">In this project, we were instructed to explore the world of “cubing”, in which we would choose a twisty puzzle each day and record the solving times for an average of 25. This module opened my eyes to the fact that there are numerous ways of learning. This project was a physical representation that there were always more than one solution to a problem. </p>
    
    <h3>AYHackathon</h3>
      <p class="text">The AYHackED module had us create a program that would assist in accomplishing one of the 17 UN Sustainability Goals. The goal we decided to work towards was  accessible education. Our program was a website that acted as a hub for numerous educational websites, allowing users to have all the resources they needed to learn. This was the first time I put my HTML/CSS and JS skills to the test outside of Khan Academy.  Overall, I feel that this project significantly helped in my web page development skills.</p>
    
    <h3>Micro-Bit</h3>
      <p class="text">The Micro-Bit module was a project where we had to create a program using the BBC Micro-Bit. This was another project that I enjoyed working through as I enjoy hands-on activities. To program the Micro-Bit, we used the BBC Micro-Bit make code editor, which used JS in the form of blocks you could drag around. I found this to be very useful in visualizing what was happening with the code. This experience helped my programming skills through learning to visualize what I want to happen then coding it. </p>
    
    <h3>Creative Live Coding</h3>
      <p class="text">In this module, we followed one of Dan Shiffman’s coding challenges and had to recreate his live coding in a presentation to the class. Along with this, we also added our own modifications to the programs. In this module, we created the popular game “Asteroids”, which was a fantastic opportunity to use OOP. Along with OOP, many of the concepts from Natural Simulations were used, such as forces, vectors and angular movement. I enjoyed this project since I played “Asteroids” when I was younger, so it was very interesting to see how I could create my own version. </p>
    
    <h3>AY Game Jam</h3>
      <p class="text">In this project, I applied what I learnt from the Phaser.js course in Codecademy to create a game. I decided to modify one of the games that were created during the course. Over the course of this project, there were many many instances of trial and error as it was a modification of JavaScript which I was not quite comfortable/familiar with. Although in the end, I felt much more confident in my Phaser coding skills. Over this project, much like many of the other ones, I have learnt to look for other resources available to me to learn and solidify my comprehension of the topics. </p>
